# Sleeping_Barber
A multi-threaded approach for solving sleeping barber problem

The program implements multi-thread concept on Sleeping Barbers Problem. There are two doors to a small barbershop, an entrance, 
and an exit. Within the shop, there is a group of N barbers who spend their entire time serving clients, one at a time. 
Each barber has a chair where the client sits when their hair is cut. A barber sleeps in his chair when there are no customers 
in the shop waiting to get their hair cut. When a customer enters the shop and finds the barber sleeping, he wakes up the barber, 
sits in the barber's chair, and sleeps while his hair is cut.
